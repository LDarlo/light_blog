<h2> Now Spring Cleaning is out of the way, it’s time for the Summer Stock up. We’re talking lights (cameras and action not included) When Summer kicks in you don't just enjoy nature’s beauty, you have to compete with it. And of course show off to your friends just how well you can throw  a room together, and nothing ties a room together better than the right lighting. So here are some staples of summer lighting and the creative ways they can be used to keep ahead of the competition.</h2>
    
<h2><strong>The Humble RGB</strong></h2>

    <p>During summer nights it can be disappointing to end the fun and wait for the summer light to return the next morning. So to keep the season alive in your home at night why not incorporate some character lights such as the Campervan RGB Touch Lamp, summer of love nostalgia included. With RGB rotating lighting, which can be set to a specific colour with a tap of the caravan roof. This is the simplest of our list as it has only one step, switch it on and watch the colours flow.</p>

    <h2><strong>Fairest Lights of them All</strong></h2>

    <p>Alternatively you could get crafty with some fairy lights such as this collage of flowers, lights and birds affixed to an old bird feeder. <br> Subtle and delicate, you can’t go wrong with these lights. The level of freedom and creativity available at your fingertips when you use fairy lights can be astonishing, but luckily they look just as amazing laid out on a surface without any manoeuvring.</p>

    <h2><strong>Garden Lights Galore</strong></h2>
